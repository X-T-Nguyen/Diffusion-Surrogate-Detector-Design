# Differentiable Surrogate for Detector Simulation and Design with Diffusion Models

This repository contains the code for the paper:

**"Differentiable Surrogate for Detector Simulation and Design with Diffusion Models"**  
by Xuan Tung Nguyen et al., [arXiv link TBD].

The project provides a conditional denoising-diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to simulate electromagnetic calorimeter showers. The model can generate high-fidelity, differentiable shower distributions conditioned on detector geometry, material, and incoming particle energy.
